# Phenobottle
The Phenobottle is an open-source Raspberry Pi based tissue culture flask photobioreactor used for growing microalgae. 

Each Phenobottle has intergrated physiological sensors such as optical density (which provides a proxy for the growth rate of the microalgal culture) and chlorophyll a fluorescence (which provides information regarding the light reactions of photosynthesis). 

The archeitecture of the Phenobottle from both a software and hardware perspective can be adjusted to accomidate new sensors, novel operational routines, graphing procedures etc. 

In this repository users can find:
  1. 3D models for 3D printing a Phenobottle
  2. Electronic schematics for the custom Phenobottle circuit board
  3. Scripts for running the Phenobottles
  4. Additional information such as a bill of materials etc.
