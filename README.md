# Phenobottle
The Phenobottle is an open-source Raspberry Pi based tissue culture flask photobioreactor used for assessing growth and photophysiology in microalgae.

The first version of the Phenobottle (v0.1) was developed as a way of conducting high-time series physiological experiments with microalgae. Version 0.1 of the device features a range of environmental controls (light (quality/quantity), air(CO2) and mixing) and phyiological sensors (optical density (growth), chlorophyll fluorescence (photosynthesis)).

The architecture of the Phenobottle from both a software and hardware perspective can be adjusted to accommodate new sensors, novel operational routines, graphing procedures etc.

In this repository users can find:
1.	3D models for 3D printing a Phenobottle
2.	Electronic schematics for the custom Phenobottle circuit board
3.	Scripts for running the Phenobottles
4.	Additional information such as a bill of materials etc.

# Future of The Phenobottle
The Phenobottle is currently being updated to version 0.2. This will feature several environmental controls that were not featured the original version (v0.1) of the device. Additonal environmental sensors will also feature in version 0.2 along with a graphical user interface. 

If you would like to learn more about the progress of this version please email: [harvey_bates@hotmail.com](harvey_bates@hotmail.com) or [harvey.bates@student.uts.edu.au](harvey.bates@student.uts.edu.au)

## Downloading files from this repository
As the Phenobottle is being updated constantly, please download the released versions of the device from the releases tab (located on the right hand side of the screen). This contains all the files needed to 3D-print and control Phenobottles as well as some information about the required equipment. 

If you wish to clone the main repository you may; however, as there are new versions of the Phenobottle in the works, the files may not work as planned.
